# Caution

These tests, which are not written by yourself, might turn you into a Tester believer. Originally, tests are meant to be written by yourself. We do not recommend using Testers. However, there are many things to be gained from tests. Also, we do not recommend using these tests during reviews, as they may hinder discussions during Evaluation.

Furthermore, as stated in the review requirements, if any issues are found, please discuss how to resolve them to ensure the same problem does not occur again. Please do not conclude the review by simply saying, "I'll lower the evaluation because the Tester gave an NG."
